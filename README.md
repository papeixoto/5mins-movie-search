# Movie Search App for 5mins

## Setup

1. `npm install` – installs dependencies.
2. `npm run ios` – to launch the iphone emulator.

## Improvements

- API key for https://www.themoviedb.org/ in .env file that's not sent to git
- debounce function in search bar to not doing a request at each keystroke
- filter results
- make use of the paginated results

### Notes (Best UI Libraries)

I liked UI kitten's demos in the mobile app (inspiration for movieScreen) but they have no search bar. I'll go with React Native Elements because it's the most popular and has the search bar component.

- React Native Elements (20K Github stars with more than 25 components.)

- React Native Paper (7.8K stars on Github and provides more than 30 components)

- React NativeBase (14K Github start)

- React Native UI kitten (8K stars)

- React Native Materila Kit (4.5K stars)
